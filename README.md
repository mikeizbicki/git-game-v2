#Level 0
Welcome to Level zero and welcome to the git game! 
Letâ€™s jump right in. 
As you can see there are multiple files in this branch when you run ```ls```. 
Your task is to count all the lines of code and text in the files.
Once this is done you are to checkout to the branch that is named after the total number of lines. 
So if the total number is 2 then you would checkout to 2. 
Are you following me? 
Good!
