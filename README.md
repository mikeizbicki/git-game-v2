#Level 0
Welcome to level zero, letâ€™s jump right in! 

This level is designed to show you the power of ```git ls-files``` command.
As you can see there are multiple files in this branch when you run ```ls```. 
Your task is to count all the lines of code and text in the files.
Once this is done you are to checkout to the branch that is named after the **total** number of lines. 
So if the total number is 2 then you would checkout to the branched named 2. 
Are you following me? Good!
